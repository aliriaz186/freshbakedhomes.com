            </h3>

                <p>
                    It has been a while since a hurricane devastated South Florida, but we all know its coming. We are
                    building hurricane proof homes for Florida and the Bahamas to insure that average people have a
                    great
                    option for housing that is affordable and safe for the future of our ever changing, more violent
                    weather.
                </p>


                <p> The damage from a hurricane comes from debris in the air hitting a window or door, or even a wall. A
                    typical home has a roof that catches air and doors and windows that leak air. A tree branch falling
                    on a
                    home can create a hole that lets the hurricane inside. A small pebble against a window pane or
                    window in
                    a door creates that same hole. Then there is the design of the typical wall. Wooden studs that flex
                    in
                    the wind with insulation between them. The flexing wood makes gaps in the exterior wallboards and
                    creates the perfect conditions for home destruction. Cement block homes are better but with a door
                    frame
                    a few inches off the ground, you are still welcoming the destructive power of the storm into your
                    home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We started with these facts and designed a home that erases all these possibilities.</p>

                <p> Firstly we build our homes off the ground. The height can range from one meter to as high as you
                    think
                    the highest storm surge possible can be. At one meter the home is perfectly cooled by air flowing
                    under
                    and over the home. At 3 meters you now have a carport. This is the type of flexibility that
                    incorporates
                    your advanced planning into the actual design.</p>

                <p>
                    Next we use a virgin ocean shipping container. These containers are made to support 7 containers on
                    their frame. Each of those containers can hold 29 metric tonnes of goods. That is 203 metric tonnes
                    of
                    impact protection from a tree falling on the home. (203,000 kg or 447,500 lbs)</p>

                <p>
                    We install double pane safety glass in all the doors and windows for everyday protection against
                    flying
                    debris, but that is not what protects against the hurricane. Our homes come with a front deck and a
                    roof
                    deck that span the entire length of the container. These decks are made of composite bamboo planks
                    over
                    2 inches in thickness. When a hurricane is coming simply pivot the decks over the front and back of
                    the
                    container home and you have an armoured wall against flying debris. When the hurricane is over,
                    simply
                    pivot them back in place and your house is none the worse for wear.</p>
                <p>
                    What about the front and back of the container? The back of the container is untouched in
                    construction.
                    There is no way for a hurricane to damage it. The front of the container still has the swinging
                    steel
                    doors. We install our full length glass doors just inside these steel doors so when a hurricane
                    comes
                    you simply close the doors for complete safety.</p>
                <p>
                    Imagine being caught in the first category 6 hurricane in history. Then imagine you are the only
                    home
                    left after the hurricane. Yes its that safe! Yes its that unique!</p>
