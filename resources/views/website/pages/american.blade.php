                <p>The first location for our container homes in the United States is South Florida. Building for the
                    American marketplace requires the assistance of an Engineering firm for the Certificate of
                    Occupancy. Many people who want to build their own home, or order a home online either skip this
                    step or don’t know the importance of this step. The worst thing that can happen to a new homeowner
                    who bought a container home is to receive it only to realize its not up to code. All of our homes
                    are designed in partnership with an engineering group that makes sure the homes are up to code in
                    South Florida..</p>
                <p>You deserve a safe, healthy environment to live. Fresh Baked Homes uses only virgin Ocean containers
                    and new design construction from new materials. If you buy a used container you never know what has
                    been shipped in it. You never know what materials have permeated the floor With our homes you are
                    assured that not only are we using world class materials that will last a lifetime, but also that
                    the </p>
                <p>materials have not been tainted by poisons or chemicals that can hurt your health over time.</p>
                <p>See the gallery of models that we currently build on the <b> “HOW TO BUY” </b>page. Choose from one
                    of those
                    or tell us what you are dreaming of and we will help you build it. </p>
