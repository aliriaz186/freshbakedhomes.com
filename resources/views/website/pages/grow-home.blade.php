                <p>If you are planning for severe weather changes to come in the near future OR if you just want to have
                    as much food security as housing security in your home plan, then consider our Grow Home.</p>
                <p>Our grow home concept is very simple. We take a standard container home and add a grow pod. A grow
                    pod is a 40 foot container that is pre-fitted with LED grow lights, a water management system, an
                    environmental control system, and a small workshop. Enough to keep a family of 4 fed well year round
                    OR to create income from a cash crop. Our LED lighting partner has begun assisting us in building
                    the first prototype that will be shipped to Washington State this summer.</p>
                <p>We will create a video diary of the build so you can see the quality and thoughtful engineering that
                    went into this design.</p>
                <p>Stay Tuned!</p>
